# Mobile_Sales_DashBoard


The mobile sales dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales trends, covering 12 months of data. It includes a Month-to-Date (MTD) report and a Same Period Last Year (SPLY) comparison to track performance over time. The dashboard details mobile models, payment methods, and customer purchasing patterns. Key insights highlight top-selling models, preferred payment options, and revenue trends. The MTD report helps monitor current sales progress, while the SPLY comparison identifies year-over-year growth or decline. This data-driven approach aids in strategic decision-making, optimizing sales strategies, and understanding market demand effectively for improved business performance and customer engagement.
