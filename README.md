# Mobile_Sales_DashBoard


The Mobile Sales Dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of sales trends over 12 months, offering insights into revenue, customer preferences, and product performance. It features a Month-to-Date (MTD) report to track current sales progress and a Same Period Last Year (SPLY) comparison for year-over-year performance evaluation. The dashboard highlights top-selling mobile models, preferred payment methods, and customer purchasing behaviors. By identifying revenue trends and market demand, businesses can optimize sales strategies and enhance customer engagement. The MTD report helps in real-time sales monitoring, while the SPLY comparison detects growth patterns or declines. This data-driven approach enables informed decision-making, ensuring businesses stay competitive. By leveraging these insights, companies can refine marketing strategies, adjust inventory, and improve customer experience. The Mobile Sales Dashboard is an essential tool for maximizing sales efficiency and driving business growth.
